## 5 Free SCPs to Use Today

*The fourth in a collection of 5 handy SCPs to apply to your AWS cloud to quickly tighten up your security controls!*

### TO CONSIDER BY USE CASE

#### Enforce encryption of files

This SCP will deny anyone from uploading unencrypted files to S3 – except for any known exceptions you want to add in. First, it denies any file upload that isn’t encrypted, and second it must be a specific type of encryption. This is a great policy to use where you want centralized controls (as opposed to bucket by bucket access control) like in the case of a production account.

```json

          "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": "false"
        },
        "StringNotEqualsIfExists": {
          "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": ["AES256", "aws:kms"]
        }
      }
    }
    ]
}
```
